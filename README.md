# Integrating Machine Learning in UAV Design for Enhanced Autonomous Human Face Detection

This repository documents the work on my BSc Mechanical Engineering thesis project at Dokuz Eylul University. The project's focus was on enhancing the autonomous human face detection capabilities of UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) for defence security applications using machine learning.

## Project Overview

- **Period**: Sep 2019 â€“ Feb 2021
- **Objective**: To design and integrate a machine learning model with UAVs for autonomous human detection with high accuracy.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, OpenCV, MATLAB, SolidWorks.

## Repository Structure

### Face_Recognition
- `face_recognition.py`: The primary script for face detection and recognition using machine learning algorithms.
- `haarcascade_eye.xml`, `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`: XML files containing Haarcascade classifiers for eye and frontal face detection.

### Haarcascade_Algorithm
- Scripts and XML classifiers for detecting various facial features using the Haarcascade algorithm.
- `haarcascade_smile.xml`: Classifier for smile detection.

### Key Achievements
- Developed a drone capable of performing autonomous human face detection with an accuracy of 99.8%.
- Successfully led a student team through the design, development, and integration phases of the project.
- Utilized MATLAB for the control systems and SolidWorks for the physical design of the drone.

## About the Haarcascade Algorithm

The Haarcascade Algorithm is a machine learning object detection method used to identify objects in an image or video. In this project, we used it to enhance UAVs' ability to detect human faces autonomously.
